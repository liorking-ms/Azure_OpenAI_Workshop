# Food orders – speech to text to JSON – get a food order, use Azure AI Speech Cognitive service to transform 
# speech to text and then using Azure OpenAI GPT3.5 to extract a JSON object that represents the order and can be used to search in a Database
# In this case we are extracting restaurant order entities.
# try saying:  I would like to order a large burger which French fries and a large coke.
